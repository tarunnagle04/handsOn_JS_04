    <h3>Iterations Statements</h3>
    <p>1.Write a program that takes an array as input from the user and find out the product of the elements.
        Note: You have to complete Find_Prod. No need to take any input.</p>
    <pre>
        const Find_Prod = (array, N) => 
        {
            let product = 1;
            for(let i = 0; i<(N); i++) {
              product =( product * array[i]);
            }
            
            return product;
        }
    </pre>
    <p>2.Write a program which takes an array as input from the user and find out the sum of the array elements..</p>
    <pre>
        const Find_Sum = (array, N) => 
        {
            let sum = 0;
            let i = 0 
            while(i < N) {
                sum = sum + array[i]
                i++;
            }
        
            return sum;
        };
    </pre>

                    count++;
                }
            }
            return count;
        };
    </pre>

    <pre>
        const findEvenOdd = (N, Arr) => 
        {
            let B = [0, 0];
            for(let i = 0;i < N;i++) {
                if(Arr[i]%2 === 0) {
                    B[0] = B[0] + Arr[i];
                } else {
                    B[1] = B[1] + Arr[i];
                }
            }
            
            return B;
        };
    </pre>

    <pre>
        const highAge = (N, Arr) => 
        {

            return array;
        };
    </pre>

    <p>9.Congratulations on making up to this question. Let us give you a fairly simple array problem to solve. If you know how to iterate through the array, you will easily be able to solve this.The problem statement is simple- given N elements, find the minimum and maximum numbers among those elements.</p>
    <pre>
        function arrayMin(arr) {
  
            let min = arr[0];  
            for(let i = 1; i< arr.length;i++ )  {
              if(arr[i] < min) {
                min = arr[i];
              }
            } 
            
            return min;
        }
        
        function arrayMax(arr) {
         let max = arr[0];  
            for(let i = 1; i< arr.length;i++ )  {
              if(arr[i] > max) {
                max = arr[i];
              }
            } 
            
          return max;
        
        }

    <p>9.Yatharth and Anamika are playing a game. Anamika loves Yatharth very much and she wants to share a chocolate bar with him in which each of the squares consists of an integer represented by A[i]. She decides to share a contiguous segment of the chocolate bar selected such that the length of the segment matches Yatharth's birth month M and the sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birthday D. You must determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate..</p>
    <pre>
        function Birthday_Game(arr,D ,M) {
            let count = 0;
              for(let i = 0;i<(arr.length)-M+1;i++) {
                let sum = 0
                for(let j = i;j<(M+i);j++) {
                  sum = sum + arr[j];
                 
                }
                 if(sum === D) {
                   count++;
                 }
              }
              
              return count;
           }
